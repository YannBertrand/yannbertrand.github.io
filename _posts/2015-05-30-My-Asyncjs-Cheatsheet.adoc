= My Async.js Cheatsheet
:hp-tags: english, tech, js

This cheatsheet's aim is to avoid to go to the docs of this library. However the complete docs can be found at https://github.com/caolan/async.

=== async.parallel(tasks, [callback])

Run the tasks array of functions in parallel, without waiting until the previous function has completed. If any of the functions pass an error to its callback, the main callback is immediately called with the value of the error. Once the tasks have completed, the results are passed to the final callback as an array.

*Arguments*

    tasks - An array or object containing functions to run. Each function is passed a callback(err, result) which it must call on completion with an error err (which can be null) and an optional result value.
    callback(err, results) - An optional callback to run once all the functions have completed. This function gets a results array (or object) containing all the result arguments passed to the task callbacks.
