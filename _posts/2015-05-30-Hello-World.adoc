=== Hey! Do you know me?

I am a passionate web developer. I love to discover new products and technologies every day. I also like to talk about my passion whether it is with newbies or with geeks.

==== My story

I was born in Zoetermeer, Netherlands on December 29, 1992. I've moved to France when I was 5 and discovered Web Development at the age of 13.

I've first learned *xHTML 1.0*, *CSS 2* and *PHP 5*. My first projects were:

- Poké-Sport: a Pokémon community website
- Atlamite: a videos sharing website for me and my friends
