=== Hey! Do you know me?

I am a passionate web developer. I love to discover new products and technologies every day. I also like to talk about my passion whether it is with newbies or with geeks.

==== My story

I was born in Zoetermeer, Netherlands on December 29, 1992. I've moved to France when I was 5 and discovered Web Development at the age of 13.

I've first learned *xHTML 1.0*, *CSS 2* and *PHP 5*. My first projects were:

- Poké-Sport: a Pokémon community website
- Atlamite: a videos sharing website for me and my friends

===== WWE-FR

A Pro-Wrestling french community website. Its main goal was to post weekly and monthly videos, but also to write some news about this entertainment. This project allowed me to discover real production, SEO and automation.

Here some numbers about this project:

- 3 years (from 2009/10/18 to 2011/08/16)
- 220.000 users
- 1.875.000 pageviews
- 3 minutes: average session duration
